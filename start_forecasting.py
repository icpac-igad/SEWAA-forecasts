#             Plenty of time:
#                We must check for existing ELR files before run_ELR.py.
#                See in run_forecasts.py in the function check_ELR_files().
#                Without changing check_ELR_files(), currently ELR will not run.
#                The only number you might want to change in this file is minutes_to_wait below.
